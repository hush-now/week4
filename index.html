        <dd>  This week, we had a discussion offline with our mentor Li Qi and decided to first create a 3D model and floor plan for our project. Firstly, we conceptualized and practiced the floor plan, and separately depicted the brushless motor, sleeve, operating rod, and fixed bracket, so that we could analyze the motion of the entire model more intuitively and optimize it better. Then, our team disassembled the 3D model, and each person was responsible for one part of it, We found many problems during the production process, but we first created the overall conceptual 3D image, and we will gradually solve the subsequent problems and continuously optimize the model.
